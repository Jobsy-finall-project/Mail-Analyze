Hi Ed,


Thank you so much for your interest in the Sales Manager position with XYZ Company. We appreciate you taking the time to visit our offices and interview with our team.


At this time, we have chosen to proceed with another candidate who has more leadership experience. However, we were impressed with your background and industry knowledge and feel you would be a great culture add for our company.


We will be posting a few sales positions in the coming weeks, and hope youâ€™ll consider applying again. Otherwise, we wish you the best of luck in your career endeavors.


Thank you!
Jane Chan
Executive Director of Sales
