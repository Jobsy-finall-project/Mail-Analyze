Dear Ms. Job,

I want to thank you for your interest in the RPN position at Anytown General Hospital and for all of the time you have put into the interview process. Unfortunately, we will not be offering the position to you. While your education qualifications are very impressive, we have chosen a candidate who has more hands-on experience. We will keep your resume on file, and if any other job positions become available we will keep you in mind. After you have gained some experience through volunteering, or another job position, we hope that you will re-apply at Anytown General Hospital.

On behalf of Anytown General Hospital, I thank you for your time, interest, and effort, and I wish you the best in your future career endeavors.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 123-456-7890.
